## [0.9.1] - Pipeline Definition Ergonomics - 2026-04-17

### ✨ Improvements

- **`steps` key alias**: Pipeline definitions accept `{"steps": [...]}` in addition to `{"pipeline": [...]}` for dict-based configs (JSON/YAML and in-code)
- **Batch pipeline detection**: Refined detection so that a single pipeline starting with a nested list step (e.g. `[[...], {...}]`) is no longer misread as a batch of pipelines
- **README**: Clarified nirs4all offerings and documented the stable API contracts introduced in 0.9.0

### 🧪 Tests

- Added coverage for `steps`-key pipeline definitions and nested-list batch detection edge cases

---

## [0.9.0] - Webapp-Ready Release: Stable Signatures & Schemas - 2026-04-16

### 🎯 Highlights

This release marks the first version of `nirs4all` that is **ready for integration with the nirs4all webapp**. Public API signatures (`run`, `predict`, `explain`, `retrain`, `session`, `generate`), result objects (`RunResult`, `PredictResult`, `ExplainResult`), and the workspace storage schemas (`WorkspaceStore` SQLite tables, `ArrayStore` Parquet layout, run manifest structure, `.n4a` bundle format) are now considered stable contracts that the webapp backend can depend on without risk of breaking changes within the 0.9.x line.

### ✅ Stable Contracts for the Webapp

- **Public API signatures**: module-level entry points (`nirs4all.run/predict/explain/retrain/session/generate`) have finalized keyword arguments and return types
- **Result schemas**: `RunResult`, `PredictResult`, and `ExplainResult` expose a locked-in surface (`best_score`, `best_rmse`, `best_r2`, `top(n)`, `export()`) for frontend consumption
- **Workspace schema**: SQLite tables (runs, pipelines, chains, logs, artifacts, predictions metadata) and Parquet array layout are frozen for the 0.9.x series
- **Run manifest**: `dataset_info`, versioning fields, and run identifiers stable for dataset-compatibility checks
- **Bundle format**: `.n4a` export/load contract stable for prediction and retraining workflows

### 🔧 Chores

- Version bumped to 0.9.0 to signal webapp-readiness and schema stability

## [0.8.2] - DuckDB Stability, Branch/Merge Fixes & Parallel Tests - 2026-02-25

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### DuckDB / Storage Stability
- **`WorkspaceStore` atexit handler**: Registers an `atexit` callback to close the DuckDB connection on interpreter shutdown, preventing segfaults when the process exits without an explicit `close()` call
- **`_jittered_delay` return type**: Fixed return type to always be `float`, removing potential `int` return that caused type errors in retry logic

#### Branch / Merge Pipeline Correctness
- **Preserve preprocessing chains after merge** (closes #24): `MergeController.add_merged_features()` was calling `reset_features()` which wiped per-branch preprocessing history from the run summary `Preprocessing` column. Fix builds composite processing names from branch contexts before the reset; added 3 helper methods to `MergeController`, fixed 6 call sites, and removed dead code in `dataset.py`
- **Runner ownership in `RunResult`**: `RunResult` now tracks `WorkspaceStore` ownership so it is closed deterministically when the result object is garbage-collected or used in a `with` block, preventing premature closure when the store is shared across `retrain()` and `session` workflows

### 🧪 Tests

#### Merge Auto-Detection
- **Integration tests** (`test_merge_auto_detect.py`): Validate auto-detect merge strategy selection for duplication and separation branches across common configurations
- **Unit tests** (`test_merge_auto_detect.py`): Cover `MergeController` auto-detect logic for all merge modes

#### Separation Branch Generators
- **Integration tests** (`test_separation_branch_generators.py`): Extensive coverage for generator keywords (`_or_`, `_range_`, `_grid_`, etc.) inside separation branches, including parallelisation scenarios

#### Preprocessing Chain Regression
- **Unit tests** (`test_merge_preprocessing_chain.py`): 13 regression tests ensuring per-branch preprocessing chains survive merge operations

#### Pipeline Config Expansion
- **Unit tests** (`test_pipeline_config_separation_expansion.py`): Verify correct generator expansion for separation branch configs
- **Unit tests** (`test_pipeline_config_separation_gen_keys.py`): Confirm accurate detection of generator usage in separation branches

### 🔧 Improvements

#### Pre-publish Script
- **Parallel example categories** (`pre-publish.sh`): Example categories now run in parallel with per-category log files, reducing total pre-publish validation time

#### Operator API Changes
- **`apply_on` parameter removed** from all augmentation operators — replaced by step-level `variation_scope`

- **`lambda_axis` parameter removed** from all augmentation operators — wavelengths are now auto-injected by the controller
