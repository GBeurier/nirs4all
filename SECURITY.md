## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in nirs4all, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately via one of the following channels:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the [Security tab](https://github.com/GBeurier/nirs4all/security/advisories/new) of this repository.
- **Email**: Contact the maintainer directly at [gregory.beurier@cirad.fr](mailto:gregory.beurier@cirad.fr) with the subject line `[SECURITY] nirs4all vulnerability`.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any suggested mitigations (if known)

We aim to acknowledge reports within **5 business days** and to provide a fix or mitigation within **30 days** for confirmed issues.

## Scope

This policy covers the `nirs4all` Python library published on PyPI.

Security issues in optional dependencies (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc.) should be reported directly to those projects.
