This directory contains an archived copy of the web UI mockup that used to live
in `docs/webapp_mockup/`.

Reason for archive: the frontend assets were moved to the top-level `webapp/`
folder and should not be kept inside `docs/`. This backup keeps the original
mockup files outside of the documentation area in case you want to restore or
reference them later.

Created by migration script on request.
