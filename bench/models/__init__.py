"""
Custom Neural Network Models for NIRS Benchmarking
===================================================

This module contains custom neural network architectures designed
for NIRS spectral data analysis, including:

- NICON variants (1D CNN architectures)
- ResNet-SE (ResNet with Squeeze-Excitation)
- Various 1D CNN and MLP architectures

These models are designed to be used with nirs4all pipelines
and are compatible with TensorFlow/Keras.
