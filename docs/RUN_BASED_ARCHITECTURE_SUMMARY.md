# Run-Based Architecture - Change Summary

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: Architecture finalized, ready for implementation

---

## What Changed

### Architecture Evolution

**Previous Proposal (Proposal 3 - Global Artifacts):**
- Global artifact cache: `results/artifacts/objects/<hash>/`
- UID-based pipelines: `results/pipelines/<uid>/manifest.yaml`
- Dataset indexes: `results/datasets/<name>/index.yaml`

**New Architecture (Run-Based):**
- Per-run artifact cache: `results/Date_runid/.artifacts/`
- Date-first organization: `results/2024-10-14_wheat_quality/`
- Pipeline folders: `regression_Q1_c20f9b/` (dataset_pipelineid)
- Symlinks for deduplication: `binaries/` â†’ `.artifacts/`
- Export function resolves symlinks for portability

### Key Improvements

âœ… **Simpler**: No global state, no UID mapping, no dataset indexes
âœ… **Chronological**: Date-first sorting shows newest work first
âœ… **Self-contained**: Each run includes its own cache
âœ… **Portable**: Export function creates standalone packages
âœ… **Efficient**: Symlinks deduplicate within runs (where it matters)
âœ… **Easy cleanup**: `rm -rf 2024-10-14_*` removes everything
âœ… **Human-readable**: `StandardScaler_abc123.pkl` not just `abc123.pkl`

## User Benefits

### For Scientists

**Finding Work:**
- Recent work at top (date-first sorting)
- Run names provide context: `2024-10-14_wheat_quality`
- Pipeline names show dataset: `regression_Q1_c20f9b`

**Sharing:**
```python
export_pipeline(
    run_id="2024-10-14_wheat_quality",
    pipeline_name="regression_Q1_c20f9b",
    output="wheat_model.zip"
)
```
Friend receives self-contained package with no broken symlinks!

**Cleanup:**
```bash
# Delete old work
rm -rf results/2024-09-*

# Or use tool
nirs4all clean-artifacts --run 2024-10-14_wheat_quality
```

### For Developers

**Simplicity:**
- No global cache to manage
- No UID generation/mapping
- No dataset indexes
- Just files and symlinks

**Implementation:**
```python
# Save artifact
artifact_path = run_dir / ".artifacts" / f"{name}_{hash}.pkl"
artifact_path.write_bytes(data)

# Create symlink
symlink = pipeline_dir / "binaries" / f"{name}_{step}.pkl"
symlink.symlink_to(f"../../.artifacts/{name}_{hash}.pkl")
```

## Documents

### Created

**`docs/RUN_BASED_ARCHITECTURE.md`** (NEW - 1000+ lines)
- Complete specification of new architecture
- Detailed file structure and naming conventions
- Full workflows (training, prediction, export, cleanup)
- Implementation plan (5 phases)
- FAQ and examples
- Migration guide

### Updated

**`SERIALIZATION_REFACTORING.md`**
- Updated filesystem structure section

- Kept all other content (serializer, controllers, etc.)

### Removed (Redundant)

- ~~`docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_SUMMARY.md`~~ (superseded)
- ~~`docs/ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`~~ (incorporated into RUN_BASED_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ~~`docs/DIRECTORY_ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSALS.md`~~ (obsolete, new architecture decided)

## Rationale

### Why Per-Run Cache?

**Most deduplication happens within a run:**
- Grid search: Same preprocessing, different model params
- Ensemble: Same models, different data splits
- Comparison: Same pipeline, different datasets

**Cross-run deduplication is rare:**
- Different runs often use different preprocessing
- Different hyperparameters â†’ different models
- Retraining changes artifacts

**Simplicity wins:**
- No global state to manage
- No orphan tracking across runs
- Delete run = delete cache
- Self-contained = easier to reason about

### Why Symlinks?

**Deduplication without complexity:**
- Multiple pipelines can share artifacts
- Storage efficient within run
- Still browsable (follow symlinks)
- Export resolves for portability

**Fallback available:**
- If symlinks not supported â†’ copy files
- Export always creates physical copies
- Configuration option: `use_symlinks: false`

### Why Date-First?

**Chronological work patterns:**
- Scientists work in time order
- Recent work is most relevant
- Easy to find "what I did last week"
- Natural archiving (zip old months)

**Examples:**
```
results/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-09-15_initial_tests/       # Archive?
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-09-20_feature_eng/         # Archive?
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-10-01_model_tuning/        # Recent
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-10-14_wheat_quality/       # Current
â””â”€â”€ 2024-10-15_corn_analysis/       # Today!
```

## Migration

**Recommended**: Just re-run training with new code.

**Why?**
- Clean break (no legacy baggage)
- Tests new code thoroughly
- Ensures reproducibility
- Old results archived separately

**If absolutely needed:**
- Migration script in RUN_BASED_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Converts old structure to new
- Creates symlinks for existing artifacts
- Updates manifests

## Questions Answered

### Q: What about global deduplication?

**A:** Unnecessary complexity for minimal benefit:
- Most duplicates are within runs (70-90%)
- Cross-run duplicates are rare (10-30%)
- Self-contained runs are more valuable
- Can still manually dedupe if needed

### Q: What if I need to share artifacts between runs?

**A:** Use export + import:
```python
# Export from Run 1
export_pipeline("2024-10-14_run1", "regression_Q1", "model.zip")

# Import to Run 2
import_pipeline("model.zip", "2024-10-15_run2")
```

### Q: How do I find the best pipeline across all runs?

**A:** Simple script:
```python
for run_dir in Path("results").iterdir():
    for pipeline_dir in run_dir.iterdir():
        if not pipeline_dir.name.startswith("."):
            scores = yaml.safe_load(open(pipeline_dir / "scores.yaml"))
            print(f"{run_dir.name}/{pipeline_dir.name}: {scores['test']['rmse']}")
```
