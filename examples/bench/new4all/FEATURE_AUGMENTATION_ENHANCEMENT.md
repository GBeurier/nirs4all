# Feature Augmentation Enhancement

## Summary

Enhanced the PipelineRunner_clean.py to properly manage data flow for feature augmentation operations, addressing the user's request for the runner to take control of data management and support parallel execution.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Data Flow Management**
The runner now properly manages the complete data flow for feature augmentation:

```python
def _run_feature_augmentation(self, augmenters: List[Any], dataset: SpectraDataset, prefix: str):
    """
    Execute feature augmentation - runner manages data flow and parallel execution

    The runner is responsible for:
    1. Getting the current train set
    2. Managing the data flow for each augmenter
    3. Adding new features to the dataset
    4. Handling parallel execution if enabled
    """
```

### 2. **Train Set Extraction with Context**
- Runner extracts the current train set applying context filters
- Validates that train data exists before proceeding
- Reports feature counts before and after augmentation

```python
# Get current train set for augmentation - apply context filters
train_view = dataset.select(partition="train", **self.context.current_filters)
if len(train_view) == 0:
    print(f"{prefix}  ⚠️ No train data found for feature augmentation")
    return
```

### 3. **Parallel Execution Support**
- Configurable parallel execution using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Thread-safe augmentation application
- Proper error handling and reporting per augmenter

```python
if self.max_workers and len(augmenters) > 1:
    self._run_feature_augmentation_parallel(augmenters, dataset, train_view, prefix)
else:
    self._run_feature_augmentation_sequential(augmenters, dataset, train_view, prefix)
```

### 4. **Individual Augmentation Logic**
Each augmenter is processed with:
- Operation building delegated to PipelineBuilder
- Train feature extraction
- Transformer fitting and transformation
- Unique processing tag generation
- Feature addition back to dataset

```python
def _apply_feature_augmentation(self, augmenter, dataset: SpectraDataset, train_view, prefix: str, aug_num: Optional[int] = None):
    """
    Apply single feature augmentation - runner manages the complete data flow

    Process:
    1. Build operation from config
    2. Get train features
    3. Fit and transform using the operation's transformer
    4. Create unique processing tag
    5. Add transformed features to dataset
    """
```

### 5. **Robust Interface Handling**
- Uses `hasattr` and `getattr` to safely access operation attributes
- Graceful fallback if dataset doesn't support feature augmentation
- Type-safe attribute access to avoid linter issues

```python
# For feature augmentation, we need to access the underlying transformer
if hasattr(operation, 'transformer'):
    transformer = getattr(operation, 'transformer')  # Use getattr to avoid linter issues
else:
    raise ValueError(f"Operation {operation.get_name()} doesn't support feature augmentation (no transformer attribute)")
```

### 6. **Processing Tag Generation**
- Creates unique tags for each augmentation based on transformer class and parameters
- Ensures traceability of augmented features

```python
# Create unique processing tag for this augmentation
transformer_name = transformer.__class__.__name__
params_hash = hash(str(sorted(transformer.get_params().items()))) % 10000
aug_tag = f"aug_{transformer_name}_{params_hash:04d}"
```

### 7. **Error Handling and Reporting**
- Validates transformation results (same sample count)
- Thread-safe error handling in parallel execution
- Detailed progress reporting with feature counts
- Continue-on-error support

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Runner manages data and control flow, Builder handles operation creation, Operations are simple wrappers

2. **Flexibility**: Supports both sequential and parallel execution based on configuration

3. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code with proper error handling

4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new augmentation types or modify the data flow

5. **Robustness**: Proper validation and fallbacks for missing interfaces

## Usage

The enhanced runner can be used with parallel feature augmentation:

```python
# Create runner with parallel support
runner = PipelineRunner(max_workers=4, continue_on_error=True)

# Feature augmentation step in pipeline
{
    "feature_augmentation": [
        {"transformer": "PCA", "n_components": 10},
        {"transformer": "StandardScaler"},
        {"class": "sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler"}
    ]
}
```

The runner will:
1. Extract the current train set
2. Apply each augmenter in parallel (if enabled)
3. Add new features to the dataset with unique tags
4. Report progress and results

This implementation fully addresses the user's requirements for proper data management and parallel execution support in feature augmentation.
