# Context Management System - Implementation Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Successfully redesigned and implemented a robust pipeline context management system for flexible, nested ML pipeline operations. The system provides correct scoping, indexing, and data selection for all pipeline operations using a polars-based index and DatasetView abstraction.

## âœ… Completed Components

### 1. DatasetView.py - Scoped Data Access
**Purpose**: Provides filtered, context-aware access to SpectraDataset
**Key Features**:
- Polars-based index filtering for efficient data selection
- Support for multiple filter types (single values, lists, ranges)
- 2D/3D feature representations for different ML operations
- Cached sample IDs and filtered indices for performance
- Robust error handling for missing columns/values

**API Methods**:
- `get_sample_ids()` - Get filtered sample IDs
- `get_features()`, `get_targets()` - Get feature/target data
- `get_features_2d()`, `get_features_3d()` - Dimensionality-specific views
- `get_partition_split()`, `get_group_split()` - Data splitting
- `__len__()` - Sample count for filtered view

### 2. DataSelector.py - Operation Scoping Rules
**Purpose**: Provides operation-specific scoping rules for pipeline execution
**Key Features**:
- Dynamic operation type detection (transformer, model, cluster, etc.)
- Context-aware fit/transform/predict scope generation
- Support for different operation patterns and requirements
- Extensible rule system for new operation types

**API Methods**:
- `get_operation_type()` - Detect operation type from instance
- `get_fit_scope()`, `get_transform_scope()`, `get_predict_scope()` - Generate scopes
- `_get_transformer_scopes()`, `_get_model_scopes()` - Type-specific rules

### 3. PipelineContext.py - State Management
**Purpose**: Manages hierarchical pipeline state and scope tracking
**Key Features**:
- Hierarchical scope stack for nested contexts
- Branch and processing level tracking
- Augmentation and source management
- Filter composition and inheritance
- Robust state management for complex pipelines

**API Methods**:
- `push_scope()`, `pop_scope()` - Scope stack management
- `get_current_filters()` - Current filter state
- `push_branch()`, `pop_branch()` - Branch management
- `push_processing()`, `pop_processing()` - Processing level tracking

### 4. Enhanced PipelineRunner.py - Integrated Execution
**Purpose**: Orchestrates pipeline execution with context awareness
**Key Features**:
- Unified parsing loop for all pipeline step types
- DatasetView integration for scoped operations
- Context-aware operation execution
- Support for complex multi-step pipelines
- Comprehensive error handling and execution tracking

**Key Methods**:
- `run()` - Main pipeline execution entry point
- `_run_step()` - Individual step execution with context
- `_execute_operation()` - Operation execution with DatasetView
- Context integration in fit/transform/predict phases
