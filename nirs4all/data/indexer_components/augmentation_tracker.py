class AugmentationTracker:
    """
    Manage origin and augmented sample relationships.

    This class encapsulates the critical two-phase selection pattern that
    prevents data leakage across cross-validation folds when working with
    augmented samples.

    Key concepts:
    - Base samples: origin == sample (self-referencing)
    - Augmented samples: origin != sample (references base sample)
    - Two-phase selection: Select base samples first, then their augmentations

    The two-phase approach ensures that if a base sample is in the test set,
    all its augmentations also stay in test (preventing leakage).
