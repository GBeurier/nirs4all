## 1. Command-Line Executable (`nirs4all` CLI) ‚≠êÔ∏è

- **Goal:** Make nirs4all usable from the command line for training, prediction, and evaluation.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Create a CLI entry point (`nirs4all`).
  - [ ] Support commands: `train`, `predict`, `finetune`, `evaluate`, `viz`, etc.
  - [ ] Allow passing config files, model presets, and data paths as arguments.
  - [ ] Provide help and usage documentation.
  - [ ] Add CLI tests and examples.
  
---

## 2. Easy Prediction on New Data ‚≠êÔ∏è

- **Goal:** Allow users to run predictions on new datasets (folders or files) with a single command or function call.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement a `predict` CLI and Python API that:
    - Loads a trained model and its pipeline. (either the hascode, the path or the config)
    - Applies all necessary preprocessing/transformations to a dataset to predict.
    - Handles various input formats (CSV, folder, etc.).
    - Outputs predictions in a user-friendly format (CSV, JSON, etc.).
  - [ ] Document the prediction workflow for end-users.

## 3. Config Presets & Command-Line Options ‚≠êÔ∏è

- **Goal:** Provide ready-to-use configuration presets for common tasks and models.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Define a library of config presets (YAML/JSON/Python) for:
    - Regression/classification/binary tasks.
    - Popular models (PLS, RF, NICON, etc.).
    - Typical pipelines (scaling, SNV, SG, etc.).
  - [ ] Allow CLI/API to select and override presets.
  - [ ] Document available presets and how to customize them.

## 4. PyTorch Integration üî∂

- **Goal:** Support PyTorch models in the same way as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Finalize PyTorch model builder and manager.
  - [ ] Ensure pipelines, training, prediction, and finetuning work for PyTorch.
  - [ ] Add tests and examples for PyTorch models.
  - [ ] Document PyTorch integration and usage.

---

## 5. Stacking & Model Ensembling üî∂

- **Goal:** Enable stacking/ensembling of multiple models (meta-models trained on predictions of base models).
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement stacking pipeline (scikit-learn style, but compatible with nirs4all configs).
  - [ ] Allow stacking of heterogeneous models (sklearn, TF, PyTorch).
  - [ ] Support cross-validation and meta-model training.
  - [ ] Add config options and CLI support for stacking.
  - [ ] Provide examples and documentation.

---

## 6. Results Browser & Visualization üî∂

- **Goal:** Provide tools to browse, compare, and visualize experiment results.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Develop a results browser (CLI, notebook, or web-based).
  - [ ] Visualize metrics, predictions, confusion matrices, feature importances, etc.
  - [ ] Allow filtering/sorting by dataset, model, metric, etc.
  - [ ] Export visualizations and reports.
  - [ ] Integrate with experiment folders and centralized results.

---

## 7. Data Visualization (Dataviz) for Results & Data üî∂

- **Goal:** Offer advanced visualization for datasets and model outputs.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Plot spectra, mean/variance, class distributions, correlations, etc.
  - [ ] Visualize transformation effects (before/after).
  - [ ] Show prediction vs. actual, residuals, feature importances.
  - [ ] Integrate with results browser and CLI.

---

## 8. Group Management (Loading & Splitting) üî∂

- **Goal:** Support group columns for stratified/grouped splitting and analysis.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Enhance data loader to recognize and load group columns.
  - [ ] Allow group-based splitting in pipelines and splitters.
  - [ ] Document group usage and best practices.

---

## 9. Config Generator (Combinatorial Experiment Generator) üî∂

- **Goal:** Automatically generate combinations of models, preprocessings, and parameters for large-scale experiments.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement a config generator (Python API and CLI).
  - [ ] Allow grid/random search over models, pipelines, and hyperparameters.
  - [ ] Integrate with experiment runner and results browser.
  - [ ] Document usage and provide templates.

---

## 10. Parametric Augmentation (Advanced Data Augmentation) üîπ

- **Goal:** Support parametric and customizable data augmentation strategies.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement parametric augmentation operators (e.g., noise, warping, mixup).
  - [ ] Allow augmentation parameters to be tuned or randomized.
  - [ ] Integrate with pipelines and config generator.
  - [ ] Document available augmentations and usage.

---

## 11. Enhanced Data Loading & CSV Loader üî∂
